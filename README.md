# Skyclient Image Model

The base for an API to aid in Skyclient support channel automation.

Currently uses the [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) model generator. I plan on integrating it into an API for use in discord bots.

Also experimenting with tensorflow, but not getting anywhere...

Pull Requests are appreciated!
